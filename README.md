A Python-based interactive application for visualizing and understanding various graph algorithms. The simulator provides an intuitive graphical interface for creating graphs and animating algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Prim's Algorithm, and Kruskal's Algorithm.

Features
Interactive Graph Creation:

Add nodes and edges manually with visual feedback.
Randomize edge weights for quick testing.
Clear the canvas to start over.
Graph Traversal Algorithms:

Animates BFS and DFS, showcasing step-by-step exploration of the graph.
Highlights visited nodes and provides data structure snapshots (queue/stack).
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms:

Demonstrates Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms with dynamic visualization.
Highlights the edges in the MST as they're added.
Pastel Themed Visualization:

User-friendly design with customizable colors to enhance visual appeal.
Multi-Threaded Simulation:

Each algorithm animation runs independently for a smooth user experience.
